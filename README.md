# PointerBasedSort
COSC-1137 â€“ College Assignment

Project Overview - This C++ program was created to generate a list of random integers. It then sorts the list
in ascending order using a pointer-based selection sort, and identifies any duplicate values. This was created
while at UHV for COSC-1137. It demonstrates programming concepts such as pointer manipulation, array sorting, 
and the usage of vectors.

Objectives of the program - Practice pointer arithmetic with arrays and to implement a custom selection sort
by using a max index approach. Detect and store duplicate values while using vectors.

Features of the program - 
  * Random Array Generation : Will generate 50 integers between 10 and 100 and stores the values in an integer
      array called "list".
  * Pointer-Based Selection Sort : Will sort the array in an ascending order by repeatedly finding the maximum
      value and moving it to the end, and uses integer pointers for all element manipulation.
  * Duplicate Detection : Uses two pointers to iterate through the sorted array and identifies duplicate values
      and stores a single copy of each duplicate in a vector. It then displays duplicate values or a message if
      no duplicates are found.

Files - 
  * Main source file : Source.cpp
  * Input file for the program : SP23_1137_Lab4_input.txt

How to run - 
  * Compile with a C++ compiler.
  * Ensure "SP23_1137_Lab4_input.txt" exists in the same directory.
